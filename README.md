# How to Build PermissionsEx 1.6.4

## What You Need

To build (make) PermissionsEx for Minecraft version 1.6.4, you need a special file called:

**craftbukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.jar**

This file is not included with this project because of rules about sharing it.

## What To Do

1. Find and download the file `craftbukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.jar` from a safe place on the internet, or make it yourself if you know how.
2. Put this file inside a folder named `jars` in your project’s main folder. If the `jars` folder does not exist, create it.

It should look like this:

```
permissionsex-1.6.4/
  └── jars/
       └── craftbukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.jar
```

3. After that, you can build the project as normal.

## Important Notes

* The project needs this file to build correctly.
* Do **not** share this file with others or put it online.
* If the build gives errors about missing files, check if the `craftbukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.jar` file is in the right place.
